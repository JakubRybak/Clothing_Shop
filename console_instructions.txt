Please perform the search for 'coat with belt' again and then open your browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12, and then navigating to the "Console" tab).
Look for the output of the `console.log` statements I've added.
Specifically, I'm interested in:
1.  Is "initializeTooltips called." appearing?
2.  What is the value of "Existing tooltips found:" and "New tooltips to initialize:"?
3.  Are there any JavaScript errors in the console?

This information will help me understand why the tooltips are not appearing.
